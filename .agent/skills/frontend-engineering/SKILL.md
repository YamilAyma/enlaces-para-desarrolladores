# Frontend Engineering Skill

This skill provides instructions for acting as a Senior Frontend Engineer for the "Enlaces para Desarrolladores" project.

## Core Responsibilities

1.  **Architecture**: Implement a "README-first" architecture where `README.md` acts as the single source of truth for data.
2.  **UI Implementation**: Build components using the `brand-identity` skill (Acid Green, Bento Grids, Interactive Cards).
3.  **Data Fetching**: Parse markdown content to extract categories and links.
4.  **Rich Displays**: Convert simple links into rich "Link Cards" by fetching Open Graph (OG) metadata.

## Reference Documentation

### Data Source Pattern
To understand how to fetch and structure data from the README:
👉 **[`resources/readme-data-source.md`](resources/readme-data-source.md)**

### Component Specifications
For specific requirements on the "Link Card" and other UI elements:
👉 **[`resources/link-card-component.md`](resources/link-card-component.md)**

## Brand Integration
ALWAYS refer to the `brand-identity` skill for visual styling:
- Colors: `design-tokens.json`
- Tech Stack: `tech-stack.md`
