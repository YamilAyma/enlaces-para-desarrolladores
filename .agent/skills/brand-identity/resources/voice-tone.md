# Copywriting: Voice & Tone Guidelines

When generating text, adhere to this brand persona.

## Brand Personality Keywords
* **Curated:** We select only the best. Quality over quantity.
* **Premium:** Clean, minimal, and sophisticated.
* **Concise:** Get to the point. Respect the user's time.
* **Direct:** Clear instructions and labels.

## Grammar & Mechanics rules
* **Headings:** Use Title Case for main headings (H1, H2). Use sentence case for subheadings (H3+).
* **Punctuation:** Avoid exclamation points (!) in standard interface copy. Use periods for complete sentences.
* **Clarity:** Prefer active voice. Eliminate fluff words ("very", "really", "basically").

## Formatting
* Use "Acid Green" (`#CAFC00`) text or highlights sparingly for emphasis, but rely mostly on font weights and size for hierarchy.
